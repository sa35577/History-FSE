John Diefenbaker’s Law of Making Discrimination Illegal:
This meant a lot of aboriginals wanted to work in André’s factory. As soon as he returned from the Korean War, many aboriginals
referred from Kwan (the aboriginal he became well-acquainted with) needed a job, but they were not accepted prior to Diefenbaker’s
law of making discrimination illegal. This encouraged André to keep working harder and increase the factory size to allow for these
jobless aboriginals to work somewhere. Within 6 months, André had 50 more spots opened to aboriginals, and the factory had more
passionate people in the working of making beautiful French desserts.
