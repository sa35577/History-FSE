The Great Depression – Losing Sales and Money:
From the middle of 1930, the factory has been slowing down a lot. They have gone down to a maximum of 5 desserts per week, losing
money very fast. Asgardé has been panicking, and looking towards relief camps in Montreal to help out to get their income. All
production comes to a halt by 1933, and the supplies not used were saved for feeding the family. All the excess sweet powder would
be watered down and drunk for a good taste but supplies for other demands (such as electricity and heat) seemed to drop very fast as
it got very costly for the family. Emile and André’s families decided to merge together into Asgardé’s home, as none of the two
families had bought a property yet.
