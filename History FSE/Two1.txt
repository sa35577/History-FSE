The Union Nationale (Splitting English and French):
Maurice Duplessis was very appealing to the Laporte family, and so were his intentions for the Union Nationale. They were willing to
give credits to farmworkers, who would supply the crops needed to help make the products which go into making foods/ingredients that
would end up in the desserts. They also begin to suspect that Canada has not done much to support the Great Depression, as Prime
Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King originally thought that the Great Depression was not a national emergency. So, the Laporte
family thought that it was better to split off from Canada, so Quebec would be in charge of itself and there would be no arrogance
from King to get federal government assistance in stopping the Great Depression.
