First Ever Electric Machine:
As André got older and older and Bruce was getting more mature to adulthood, he took over the factory. To this day, he still owns the
factory and has decided to postpone his marriage for some time in the future. In 2005, he purchased the first automated machine for a
repetitive task that required a lot of labor. Not only has this increased the workflow in the factory, but also lets the workers in
that tough station to support the other workers in assembling or making final touches to the desserts. Many other stores, since then,
are constantly buying from this factory because they understand that this factory has automated and manual production, making it very
speedy and reliable to produce well-tasting French desserts.
