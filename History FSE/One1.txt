Originally, the wife took charge of the company. Asgardé was way too busy fighting in the war with his son to keep some sort of
touch with the company. Estelle, however, was always in tension for her husband and son, and wanted to help them in any way
possible. The government approached families in Greater Montreal in 1916 for women to produce and supply weapons in the war. She
accepted so she can help them in any way possible, and just hopes they survive. She gives control of the factory to Emile, who
found it very hard to deal with the factory as she was only taught to take care of her family. She self-taught herself how to do
everything at the factory and found it very difficult to cope with the men at the factory. However, she was only allowing men to
work in the factory because although it was hard for her to admit, they knew how to do more labor tasks them women were able to
do. However, less and less men were available, and eventually she needed to start hiring women. No Aboriginal was allowed to work
however, as they were not allowed to as per the rules of the factory.
