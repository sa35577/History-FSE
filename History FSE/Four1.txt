NAFTA’S Introduction:
As the French population of Greater Montreal kept growing, Bruce decided to expand the menu of items on his factory by looking at
what people in Europe eat for dessert as well, as the increasing French population is mostly coming from Europe. This was getting
costly, but then the North American Free Trade Agreement was introduced. This allowed North American countries to trade without any
tariffs. All the toppings that were shipped along with the desserts were so much cheaper in U.S., so when the tariff was removed
with the commencing of NAFTA, Bruce started investing in lots of sprinkles and other toppings for a much cheaper price.
