Asgardé wanted to go to war. Unlike many other families in his neighborhood, he really wanted to go. Originally, he was one of 300
people that wanted to go in his township. As he lived in the Greater Montreal Area, there were about 500 other people willing to go.
His son, however, really looked up to him and wanted to go as well. He wanted to be a hero and be recognized as someone that was
willing to put his life on the line for the good of the country. He was also connected to Sam Hughes, as his grandfather and Hughes’
grandfather were very good friends in their time. André makes a fake ID in order to participate in the war, and gets in the war
alongside his father.
