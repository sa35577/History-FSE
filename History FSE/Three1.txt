Korean War: 
André remembered how his father saved hundreds in the Dieppe Raid, so he couldn’t step down to this opportunity to fight for Canada
again. He was a part of the peacekeeping force and made a friend who was a soldier from Canada that was an aboriginal named Kwan.
As he was trying to keep South Korea from being taken over by North Korea (communism vs democracy), Estelle was then in charge of
the factory. However, she was much more accepted this time as there was a variety of men and women working at the factory because
many of them pushed to keep working after the war, and she did not feel like she was lonely or being made fun of (like when Emile
was running the factory). If one thing remained, preferential treatment against aboriginals was still there.
