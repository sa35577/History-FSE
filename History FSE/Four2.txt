NBA Toronto Raptors vs. Warriors Game (CURRENT):
Many people from the California area and all over Canada are excited about the NBA finals partially held in Toronto. Many restaurants
near the area are French restaurants, so Bruce started production in advance of the NBA finals for extra deserts. The productions
paid off, as many people decided to eat at French restaurants after/prior to a game, which temporarily is boosting the sales like
crazy in the Greater Toronto Area, and therefore the factory’s selling speed. In Toronto alone, stores collectively need about 1000
every week from one good factory, which is blowing up food sales not only for Bruce’s factory, but for all food companies in Canada.
