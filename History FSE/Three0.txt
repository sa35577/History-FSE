The baby boom did pick up for the factory, which did restart after WWII ended (owned by André now). André and Christine had a baby in
that time as well (named Bruce), and ended up with lots of money to raise the money within a few years because the desserts started
becoming more and more popular again. More and more schools started showing up in the area, and although thecompetition for the
dessert market did increase, André was still able to sell at least 75 desserts to each store every week, which may have not been as
much as the Roaring ‘20s, but still enough to make a lot of money out of it. This led to their suburban area of Montreal to become
more popular and almost its own city.
